Hello! 
I am Samantha and I was born in Winconsin. My mother is German and my father is Italian, and shortly after I was born we moved back to New Jersey. 
Although I am studying economics, I am currently working in Cyber Security! 
I have never used Python or Stata, my first experience with any type of coding was last semester with you - Dr.Kaltenberg - in R Studio.
My hobbies are Snowboarding and surfing, and I am very excited to learn more about R as well as Python.
